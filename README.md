# Stupid Finger Counter 😈

The most frustrating finger counting application ever created. This program uses computer vision to count your fingers, but it has a 50% chance every second to completely forget what it was counting and restart from zero. When it forgets, it Rick Rolls you. You're also trapped in fullscreen until you either successfully count all your fingers or give up.
